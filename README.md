# Marvin

Marvin is a GPU-only neural network framework made with simplicity, hackability, speed, memory consumption, and high dimensional data in mind.

## Dependences

Download [CUDA 7.5](https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-downloads) and [cuDNN 5](https://developer.nvidia.com/cudnn). You will need to register with NVIDIA. Below are some additional steps to set up cuDNN 5. **NOTE** We highly recommend that you install different versions of cuDNN to different directories (e.g., ```/usr/local/cudnn/vXX```) because different software packages may require different versions.

```shell
LIB_DIR=lib$([[ $(uname) == "Linux" ]] && echo 64)
CUDNN_LIB_DIR=/usr/local/cudnn/v5/$LIB_DIR
echo LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$LD_LIBRARY_PATH:$CUDNN_LIB_DIR >> ~/.profile && ~/.profile

tar zxvf cudnn*.tgz
sudo cp cuda/$LIB_DIR/* $CUDNN_LIB_DIR/
sudo cp cuda/include/* /usr/local/cudnn/v5/include/
```

## Compilation

```shell
./compile.sh
```

## MNIST

1. Prepare data: run examples/mnist/prepare_mnist.m in Matlab
2. Train a model: run ./examples/mnist/demo.sh in shell
3. Visualize filters: run examples/mnist/demo_vis_filter.m in Matlab
